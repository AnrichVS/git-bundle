# Gitb

This gem simplifies working with [gems from git repositories](http://bundler.io/v1.5/git.html):
```ruby
gem 'forum_engine', git: 'https://github.com/your_name/forum_engine.git', branch: :master
```
in combination with [local overrides](http://bundler.io/v1.5/git.html#local):
```shell
bundle config local.some_gem_or_rails_engine /path/to/local/git/repository
```

## Usage examples

Let's say you have a Rails application that uses two of your own reusable Rails engines called *forum_engine* and
*blog_engine*.  This is how you include them in your Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'forum_engine', git: 'https://github.com/your_name/forum_engine.git', branch: :master
gem 'blog_engine', git: 'https://github.com/your_name/blog_engine.git', branch: :master
```

You then add local overrides to your bundle config so that you can work on them like you would work on your main Rails
application: any code change takes immediate effect.
```
bundle config local.some_gem_or_rails_engine /path/to/forum/git/repository
bundle config local.some_gem_or_rails_engine /path/to/blog/git/repository
```

This gem will make the following scenarios easier and quicker to work with:

**1. Performing the same git command on all local overrides and the main application.**

Gitb will relay any command and arguments you pass it to all local override repositories in addition to the main
repository.  In other words a **gitb pull** will run a **git pull** in all repositories.  This is what the output
will look like:
```
=== forum_engine (master)
Already up-to-date.

=== blog_engine (master)
remote: Counting objects: 72, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
remote: Total 72 (delta 16), reused 61 (delta 9), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (72/72), done.

=== your-rails-application (master)
Already up-to-date.
```

Another example is a **gitb checkout release** will run **git checkout release** in all repositories:
```
=== forum_engine (master)
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

=== blog_engine (master)
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

=== your-rails-application (master)
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
```

**2. Updating Gemfile.lock when pushing changes.**

When you want to commit and push changes, the standard process is to commit the engine git repositories first, then
run *bundle install* on the main application so that it updates the Gemfile.lock with the new git revisions (shown
below).  Add the Gemfile.lock to a commit and push the main application commits.
```
GIT
  remote: https://github.com/your_name/forum_engine.git
  revision: b9270e61abb89e1ff77fb8cfacb463e4d04388ad
  branch: master
```

With this gem you don't need to run *bundle install* to update the Gemfile.lock yourself.  When you push commits it will
detecting that your Gemfile.lock needs to be updated, run *bundle install*, add the Gemfile.lock to a new commit with an
appropriate commit message and push it with your other commits.  This is what it looks like if you run **gitb push** in
the main application:

```
=== forum_engine (master)
Counting objects: 11, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (13/13), done.
Writing objects: 100% (13/13), 2.42 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 11 (delta 6), reused 0 (delta 0)
   ba4b3bf..ca4f753  master -> master

=== blog_engine (master)
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 6 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 2.42 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.

   ac1b3bf..b4bf753  master -> master

=== your-rails-application (master)
Local gems were updated. Building new Gemfile.lock with bundle install.

Counting objects: 13, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
Writing objects: 100% (13/13), 2.32 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 13 (delta 6), reused 0 (delta 0)
   ce2b3bf..f0bf753  master -> master
```

## Installation

You can install it yourself:

```
gem install git-bundle
```

Or alternatively add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'git-bundle'
end
```

Both should allow you to use the **gitb** command anywhere
